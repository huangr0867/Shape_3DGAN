# 3D-GAN for Shape Generation
Goal: Create a dataset of 3D shapes and train a neural network to generate them.

## Generating Dataset
The dataset of spheres was made by randomly sampling the exterior of a sphere to create point clouds. The code for the dataset generation can be found in ```generate_shapes/generate3dShapes.ipynb```.
